# GoG-FlairBot
This is a flair bot for [Reddit's Gift of Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftofgames) written by [/u/charredgrass](https://www.reddit.com/user/charredgrass/) ([Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/charredGrass/)).
Its functions include reading comments and adding 1 to numbers in flairs.

#How to run

Requires [PRAW](http://praw.readthedocs.org/en/stable/). Built on PRAW version 3.2.1 and Python version 2.7.8. Change the values in the `set_config()` function. Most variables are self-explanatory. `trigger` is the word the bot looks for in the comment to show that the user wants an upgraded flair.
